# CGSO Construction Inventory

CGSO Construction Inventory is a warehouse inventory system for managing construction materials. It is built using **AngularJS** as a Single Page Application (SPA) within a **Ruby on Rails** application. The frontend communicates with the backend using **AJAX requests**.

## Features
- Inventory tracking of construction materials
- User authentication with **Sorcery**
- Pagination with **will_paginate**
- Reports and PDF generation using **Prawn**
- RESTful API endpoints for frontend-backend communication

## Prerequisites

- **Ruby 2.2.4** (Version specified in the Gemfile)
- **Rails 4.2.4**
- **Bundler**
- **PostgreSQL** (For production database)
- **SQLite3** (For development database)
